<p>Ther is a simple reason why Web Developer is such a hot job right now. Put simply, what Web Developers do is create how we experience...the web. If you proceed from the notin that every person who engages with the web would prefer a great experience, then you can say that everyone who engages with the web would prefer that aWeb Developer have done a great job. Companies of course know this, so they hire Web Developers to ensure their sites provide great experiences. So, lots of websites and lots of users means lotss of demand. LOTS of demand.</p>
